# CrumbBoard
my custom scoreboard for the script system of the minecraft server steamwar.de

The actual scoreboard event which displays the scoreboard is inside the "scoreboard.txt" file
"scoreboard-commands.txt" "scoreboard-commands-2.txt" contain the command scripts to manage the scoreboard

to use the scripts, go on steamwar.de, go to your build server with "/b", then paste the contents of the .txt files that contain scripts each in their own books. Then  open your script menu via "/script menu" and place the books on the hopper item in the gui.

To learn more about how the script system works use "/script"
